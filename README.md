## 💻 Installation
You can clone this repository OR download the .zip

When unzipping, it is necessary to run `composer` to install the dependencies and generate ***autoload***.

Go to the project folder, through the ***prompt / terminal*** and execute:
> composer install

Then just wait.

## 🛠 Configuration
All `configuration` and application files are inside the ***src*** folder.

The Database and URL settings are in the ***src / Config.php*** file

It is important to correctly configure the ***BASE_DIR*** constant:
> const BASE_DIR = '/**ProjectFolder**/public';

## 📈 Example usage
You must access the project's `public` folder.

Ideally, create a specific ***alias*** on the server that points directly to the *public* folder.

### MODEL model
```php
<?php
namespace src\models;
use \core\Model;

class User extends Model {

}
```
